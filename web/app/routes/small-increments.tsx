        <h2>Small Increments</h2>
        <p>I like to work in small increments</p>
        <p>It keeps me moving and stops me over thinking things</p>
        <p>Over my career I have learned skills that help keep increments small</p>
        <p>If you try this without knowing how you will struggle</p>
        <p>By breaking a feature into parts, say a frontend and a backend, you will have smaller increments</p>
        <p>But you will regularly find those increments are much larger than ideal</p>
        <p>To break a feature into ideal sized increments you have to be comfortable with commiting unfinished code</p>
        <p>Unfinished in the sense that much of the code won't make it into users hands, it doesn't do everything it needs to do and it requires much more work to be finished</p>
        <p>It just needs to progress the feature toward a finished state</p>
        <p>Why do this?</p>
        <p>The more value you try to add in a single increment the more complex that increment becomes</p>
        <p>There's a tipping point where the overhead caused by that complexity is greater than the small cost of writing code that will be refactored or rewritten later on</p>
        <p>Why have I decided to write about this? Well I'm making myself a website and it's pretty simple</p>
        <p>It will change a lot in the future, but that will take time</p>
        <p>I have many things I'd the website to do, I'd like it to look a certain way</p>
        <p>However I only have a few hours tonight to do <em>something</em></p>
        <p>My first increment doesn't do much, doesn't look like much but it's something</p>
